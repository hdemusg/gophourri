# Gophourri
## A Go module by Sumedh Garimella (hdemusg)

Welcome to the repository for Gophourri! This is a small module I made to teach myself Go/Golang by working on functions that I thought would be fun to make. 

### Current Features

#### Conversions
- ConvertTemp: converts between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit
- ConvertTempInput: like ConvertTemp but takes in user input
- ConvertDist: converts between both metric and customary units of distance
- ConvertMass: converts between both metric and customary units of mass

#### Probabilities
- WeightedDrawing: takes in integer weights and returns a random integer between 0 and n-1 (n being the number of weights). 
- WeightedDrawingFloat: takes in float weights and returns a random integer between 0 and n-1. 
- WeightedDrawingCSV: reads in a CSV file without a header row (first row = labels, second row = weights) and returns a random label.
- FlipCoins: flips a given number of fair two-sided coins and returns each flip's result.
- RollDice: rolls a given number of fair six-sided dice and returns the sum. 

### How to Request fixes or features

Coming soon. For now, email me at sgarimella30@gatech.edu with any fixes or suggestions and I'll see what I can do. For now I am not accepting any outside contributions to Gophourri but I may change my mind on this in the future.
